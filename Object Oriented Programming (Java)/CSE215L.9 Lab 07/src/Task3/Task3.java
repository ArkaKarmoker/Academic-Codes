/*
    Section 10.6 gives a class for Stack. Design a class named
    Queue for storing integers. Like a stack, a queue holds elements. In a stack, the
    elements are retrieved in a last-in first-out fashion. In a queue, the elements are
    retrieved in a first-in first-out fashion. The class contains:
        An int[] data field named elements that stores the int values in the
        queue.
        A data field named size that stores the number of elements in the queue.
        A constructor that creates a Queue object with default capacity 8.
        The method enqueue(int v) that adds v into the queue.
    The method dequeue() that removes and returns the element from the
    queue.
        The method empty() that returns true if the queue is empty.
        The method getSize() that returns the size of the queue.
    Draw an UML diagram for the class. Implement the class with the initial array
    size set to 8. The array size will be doubled once the number of the elements
    exceeds the size. After an element is removed from the beginning of the array,
    you need to shift all elements in the array one position the left. Write a test
    program that adds 20 numbers from 1 to 20 into the queue and removes these
    numbers and displays them.
